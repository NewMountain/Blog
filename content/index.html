    <h1>Hello world</h1>

    <p>
      This all started on Saturday January 11th. I'm so excited to start and am looking forward to sharing all sorts of wisdom.
      For now, I have a pile of TODOs, but they'll get worked on as soon as I can.
    </p>

    <h2>The list:</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>[ ] Get this content into proper version control</li>
      <li>[ ] Create a header for this page</li>
      <li>[ ] Create a footer for this page</li>
      <li>[ ] Develop a better experience/workflow</li>
      <li>[ ] Organize this content</li>
      <li>[ ] Switch to Markdown vs raw html</li>
      <li>[ ] Get everything looking good</li>
      <li>[ ] </li>
      <li>[ ] Create an about me page</li>
      <li>[ ] Create a projects "deep dive" section</li>
      <li>[ ] Look into Gatsby or just some scripts to generate</li>
      <li>[ ] Cross post to Medium automatically</li>
      <li>[ ] Create a resume page</li>
      <li>[ ] Create a blog section</li>
      <li>[ ] Populate that blog content</li>
      <li>[ ] Start building out content for the blog</li>
      <li>[ ] Maybe create a TODO section?</li>

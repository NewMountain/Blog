# About me

My name is Christopher Nyberg. You can likely find me around the internet as NewMountain. I am a father of two, three if you count the Newfoundland. I love my family, programming, building things and winter sports.

My background is pretty diverse and I have been fortunate to be able to work in a diverse range of responsibilities ranging from Russian interpreter and researcher, fixed income analyst, web developer to softwate engineer.
In programming, I truly found my passion and calling and love the feeling of making useful things from little more than a keyboard and a monitor.
I describe this feeling to my daughter as the closest thing to a super power. Making people smile and lightening the load on them is a close second for feeling awesome.

I also love to teach and mentor people newer in the field. As I feel so lucky I could find happiness here, I try my hardest to share both my
knowledge and passion with other developers.

These days, I'm in the Seattle area and have a growing interest in embedded devices and making things. If any of this sounds cool, feel free to reach out!

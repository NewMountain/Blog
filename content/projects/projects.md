# Projects

There are a few _big_ projects I have really been working on lately. I have been playing around a lot with Arduino, Raspberry Pi and C/C++ to acquire the skills I need to achieve a few short (and some longer) term goals. I'll keep the finished projects here towards the bottom

## Current

### Home Air Quality Project

This one is pretty straight forward, I'm putting as many sensors as I think would add value on an Arduino and using a Raspberry Pi to send the data up to AWS. I'll use some lambdas and stuff to create a nice little dashboard I can put on our home TV showing trends, by space, of various air quality metrics. It's useful, it's relatively easy, and has been a pretty nice introduction that I look forward to writing more about.

### DIY Mechanical Keyboard

My love of mini-keyboards is well known by those around me and I've chased it to the edge where there simply isn't _my perfect keyboard_ some I'm building my own instead. This

### This blog

Kind of meta, but it seems like for someone who works in tech, I really should actually have a blog and social media precense. I have a lot to share and a lot to learn. So, there will be a series about how I set this all up, how much it costs me and all the "behind the scenes" you may have wondered about, in case you were considering doing it yourself and needed a little push in that direction.

### Fully automated growhouse

This is a dream that I've had for years. It captivates me and is something that is on my "bucket list". There are a lot of "big, scary" problems in the world and I'll be the first to admit I am not set up to cure cancer, solve affordable healthcare, reduce global emissions and other such things. However, I feel _VERY_ strongly about hunger and while I think it will be hard, I think it's at the upper end of something I could reasonably do something about.
My idea: I would like to combine everything I've learned about embedded devices, senors and IOT, electronics, programming and web development as well as "fancy AI" topics and see if I can grow a crop, end to end, without human intervention.
To be even more concrete: my first challenge to myself: grow a tomota in a closed environment end to end without human intervention.
I feel like if I can do that, I can, hopefully, generalize my learnings to other crops and open source a viable solution or at least research into a way to produce food non-traditionally.
